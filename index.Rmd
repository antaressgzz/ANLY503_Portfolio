## About Me

Hello, I'm Ziyang Zhang, a Data Science and Analytics Student in Georgetown University. Before this, I got my B.S. in Mathematics from University of Liverpool, UK. 

I have coding experience in Python for 4 years and having expertise in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (TensorFlow), Big Data (AWS, Spark and Hadoop), SQL, and data visualization methods.

My current research interest is human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning. I'm currently a member of [infosense](http://infosense.cs.georgetown.edu/research.html) and I'm currently working a self-driving car project.
